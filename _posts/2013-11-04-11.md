## Create a marketing page for a Kickstarter project

- Build out a marketing site that shows one slide at a time (more or less).
- Start with the images and copy from the project.
- Feel free to search the web for more images.
- Feel free to make up copy.

## Requirements

- Use the full-screen height design pattern.
- Draw up 2-3 sketches. Show to another group, ask what they would do next.
- Include a nav, at least three sections, and a footer
- Include information about the people behind the project
- Include a form (for signing up, or whatever you want)

## How to write good copy

- What problem does the product solve?
- What does user want to know?
- Can you simplify?

## Steps

- Pick a topic
- Sketch site, start copy
- Wireframe, write more copy
- Code
- Iterate
