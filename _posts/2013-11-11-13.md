- SCSS = Sassy CSS.
- Sass a superset of CSS

## Sass features

- Variables
- Importing (@import)
- Color manipulation
- Mixins (@include)
- Math
- Exending rulesets (@extends)
- Invisible comments

## Notes from class

### Intro to SCSS "SASS" (Pre-processor)
- .scss _("sass")_ converts to .css
- sass is a superset of CSS, it is backwards compatible, so normal CSS works just fine in a .scss file
- Link your index.html to the compiled .css file to read
- .scss allows for nested selectors
- psuedo-selectors can be nested inside their parent using &:before
- Following an element with "&" will append the elements it is nested within in front of it.
- If you edit the .css file, and then edit the .scss file, your .css file will get over-written
- **Rule of thumb:** Don't prematurly optimize. Don't be efficient until there's something that needs to be efficient.
- Usually your .scss file will live on the server, but won't be used since  browsers only read the .css file
- // comments disappear when compiled, meaning your users won't see them

### Prepros (the app)
- [Prepros](http://alphapixels.com/prepros/) is a free application used to compile your scss to css
- Tell Prepros to track your project with scss by dragging the folder onto your prepos window
- Create a new file with the extension .scss, Prepros's sad face should go away and display your .scss file going to it's relative .css file
- 'Auto Compile' will automatically compile your .scss into .css every time you save the file
- "Open project live url" - Prepros uses a local server (virtual host) in the browser to access your website in Chrome. You'll see localhost:#### in the URL bar.

### Variables
- A variable stores information that can be re-used throughout your document.
- In .scss, you specify a variable by prefixing its name
`````
$my-color: #000;
`````
- The benefit is to allow you a simple way to change one variable, and effect multiple things on your page without having to manually edit each one.
- Another good example is saving border-radius as it's used in multiple places, and requires consistency
````
$corner: 12px;
````
- To call the variable in your .scss, apply it using
````
p {
	border-radius: $corner;
	background: $my-color;
}
````
- Variables have scope. If a variable is defined outside of all rule-sets, it is global and can be used anywhere on the page. If it is within a rule-set (it is a delcaration of one), it will on exist for the propteries inside of it.
*_rule-set = (eg. p { ... })_

### Compiling all your CSS into one file & Partials
- We do it becuase it allows the server to make just _one_ request to retreive the css, not multiple.
- If you have a .scss filename that is prefixed with an underscore, that is known as a 'partial'
- Partials are designed as stand-alone pieces of styling that can imported into the necessary files
- To include the file _reset.scss you can include it at the top of your compiled CSS using
````
@import "reset";
````
- global.scss typically lists the necessary partials, almost like a table of contents.
- It makes our lives as developers if we have sections/stylings broken out into partials as opposed to having everything on a single page.

### Colors
- You can edit colors or variables using key terms like lighten, darken
- Syntax
````
color: lighten($maroon, 50%);
````
- You can lighten, darken, desaturate, fade-out
- fade-out will convert a hex into rgba,
````
fade-out(white, .5)
````
will yield
````
rgba(255, 255, 255, .5))
````

### Mixins
- Typically you'd host mixins in their own file, and import them as a partial.

```
	@mixin name {
		-webkit-border-radius: 12px;
		   -moz-border-radius: 12px;
		     -o-border-radius: 12px;
		        border-radius: 12px;
	}

	p {
		@include name(value);
	}

````
```

	@mixin name($variable) {
		-webkit-border-radius: $variable;
		   -moz-border-radius: $variable;
		     -o-border-radius: $variable;
		        border-radius: $variable;
	}

	p {
		@include name(value);
	}

````
```

	@mixin name($variable: 6px) {
		-webkit-border-radius: $variable;
		   -moz-border-radius: $variable;
		     -o-border-radius: $variable;
		        border-radius: $variable;
	}

	p {
		@include name;
	}

````

### Math
- You can use operational math to calculate things in .scss
- eg. (100% / 4)

### Extends
- @extend .class will pull all the styling from the specified class into where the @extend is declared

### [Compass](http://compass-style.org)
- A library of commonly used mixins for us to reference and use
- Using it for sprites
	- Sprites are having separate images layered onto a single file. Servers only need to take one call to the server to retrieve it. We reposition the sprite through css in order to reveal only the image we want.
	- Compass gives you easy classes to call the images as background-images.
