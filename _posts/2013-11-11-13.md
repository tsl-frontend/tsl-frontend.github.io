## Sass

### Intro to Sass

- We developers want easy-to-read and easy-to-write CSS. The browser still wants plain jane CSS.
- The comprommise is Sass, a simpler way to write CSS, but which compiles into regular CSS.
- A `.scss` file _(stands for "sassy css")_ converts to a `.css` file.
- Sass is a _superset_ of CSS. That is, it's backwards-compatible, so normal CSS works just fine in a `.scss` file.
- Remember, browsers only read the `.css` file. They know nothing of Sass.
- **Rule of thumb:** Don't prematurly optimize. Don't be efficient until there's something that needs to be efficient.

### Prepros (the preprocessor app)

- [Prepros](http://alphapixels.com/prepros/) is a free application used to compile your Sass to CSS.
- Chosing 'Auto Compile' will automatically compile your `.scss` file into a `.css` file every time you save it.

### Set-up

- Create a `global.scss` file in your repo.
- Drag your directory to the Prepros window. It should find the Sass file and list it in the window.
- Go into Sublime and save your `global.scss` file. This will trigger Prepros to generate `global.css`.
- In your HTML, include a reference to the name of the compiled `.css` file.
- Hit the small globe icon in the lower-left (tooltip says 'Open project live url'). Prepros will set up a lightweight local server (aka "virtual host"). and open your browser to the URL of that local server. It'll b something like `localhost8001`.
- *Remember:* If you edit the CSS file, it will get over-written next time you edit the Sass

### Nested selectors

- psuedo-selectors can be nested inside their parent using `&`, like `&:before`
- Following an element with `&` will append the elements it is nested within in front of it.

### Variables

- A variable stores information that can be re-used throughout your document.
- In .scss, you specify a variable by prefixing its name: `$my-color: #000;`
- The benefit is to allow you a simple way to change one variable, and effect multiple things on your page without having to manually edit each one.
- Another good example is saving border-radius as it's used in multiple places, and requires consistency. `$corner: 12px;`
- To call the variable in your .scss, apply it using
````
p {
	border-radius: $corner;
	background: $my-color;
}
````
- Variables have scope. If a variable is defined outside of all rule-sets, it is global and can be used anywhere on the page. If it is within a rule-set (it is a delcaration of one), it will on exist for the propteries inside of it.

### Compiling all your CSS into one file & Partials

- We do it becuase it allows the server to make just _one_ request to retreive the css, not multiple.
- If you have a .scss filename that is prefixed with an underscore, that is known as a 'partial'
- Partials are designed as stand-alone pieces of styling that can imported into the necessary files
- To include the file _reset.scss you can include it at the top of your compiled CSS using `@import "reset";`
- global.scss typically lists the necessary partials, almost like a table of contents.
- It makes our lives as developers if we have sections/stylings broken out into partials as opposed to having everything on a single page.

### Colors

- You can edit colors or variables using key terms like lighten, darken
- Syntax: `color: lighten($maroon, 50%);`
- You can lighten, darken, desaturate, fade-out
- fade-out will convert a hex into rgba, `fade-out(white, .5)` will yield `rgba(255, 255, 255, .5))`

### Mixins

- Ways to store blocks of rules together.
- Espeically good for blocks of rules with variable value.
- Typically you'd host mixins in their own file, and import that file as a partial.

Example with no variable:

{% highlight scss linenos %}
    @mixin rounded-corners {
        -webkit-border-radius: 12px;
           -moz-border-radius: 12px;
             -o-border-radius: 12px;
                border-radius: 12px;
    }

    p {
        @include rounded-corners(value);
    }
{% endhighlight %}

Example with variable:

{% highlight scss linenos %}
	@mixin rounded-corners($variable) {
		-webkit-border-radius: $variable;
		   -moz-border-radius: $variable;
		     -o-border-radius: $variable;
		        border-radius: $variable;
	}

	p {
		@include rounded-corners(value);
	}
{% endhighlight %}

Example with default value if none is specified:

{% highlight scss linenos %}
	@mixin rounded-corners($variable: 6px) {
		-webkit-border-radius: $variable;
		   -moz-border-radius: $variable;
		     -o-border-radius: $variable;
		        border-radius: $variable;
	}

	p {
		@include rounded-corners;
	}
{% endhighlight %}

### Math

- You can use operational math to calculate things in .scss
- eg. `(100% / 4)`
- e.g. `($default_padding * 2)`

### Extends

- `@extend .my-class` will pull all the styling from the specified `my-class` into the ruleset where the `@extend` is declared.

### Comments

- Comments that start with `//` disappear when compiled, meaning your users won't see them.

## Compass

- A library of commonly used mixins for us to reference and use
- Click the "Use Compass" checkbox in Prepros
- [Documentation](http://compass-style.org)

## Sprites

- Sprites are little images.
- Spritemaps are all those images combined into a single file.
- Servers only need to take one call to the server to retrieve the spritemap. This makes pages faster.
- Using CSS, we can reposition the spritemap in order to reveal only the image we want.
- Compass gives you easy classes or mixins to get spritemaps to work.
- To use, click the "Full Compass Support" checkbox in Prepros
- Have a look at [santheo's GitHub Pages repo](https://github.com/santheo/santheo.github.io) for an example.
- Read the [documentation on compass-style.org](http://compass-style.org/help/tutorials/spriting/)
