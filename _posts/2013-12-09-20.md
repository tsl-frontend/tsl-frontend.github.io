## Browser testing

- Test all sites with Chrome, Safari & Firefox.
- Use iOS Simulator to test on mobile Safari (built into XCode, which is free on Mac)
- To test IE, download [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and [Windows virtual machine](http://www.modern.ie/en-us/virtualization-tools#downloads), both free.
- To test Android and other mobile browsers, use something like [BrowserStack](http://www.browserstack.com/mobile-browser-emulator)
- With any version of IE, you can test earlier versions. Invoke the F12 Develoepr Tools (found in the gear menu in the upper right corner of the window)

## Conditional CSS for just IE

- If you want to define rules that apply just in IE, create a stylesheet called, e.g., `ie.css`.
- Then load it up like this:

```html
<!--[if IE]>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/css/ie.css" media="screen, projection">
<![endif]-->
```

- If you want it to just load for versions of IE earlier than IE 9:

```html
<!--[if lt IE 9]>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/css/ie-lt-9.css" media="screen, projection">
<![endif]-->
```

- [HTML5Shim](https://code.google.com/p/html5shim/) — to make IE recognize HTML5 elements
- [Selectivizr](http://selectivizr.com/) — to make IE recognize CSS3 pseudo-classes
- [Respond.js](https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond) — to make IE support min-width & max-width for responsiveness

### Modernizr

- [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/) — Robust tool for sniffing browser features and giving you classes to hook into.

## Usability testing

- Come up with tasks, ask testee to complete them on your site
- Say to testee: "There are no wrong answers. Please tell me what you're thinking all the time."
- As tester, your role is to watch, and prod testee to talk more.
- And take notes about what you see, where they stumble.
- If they ask questions, respond with a question. e.g. "What do you think the answer is? What would expect to happen?"
- The bible on this topic is [Don't Make Me Think](http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Me-Think-Usability/dp/0321344758/) by Steve Krug
