## Tables

- Tables are how the web used to be laid out
- Now, they should only be used for laying out _tabluar data_
- e.g. spreadsheets, price comparisons, etc.
- See [this article](http://www.noupe.com/how-tos/better-ui-design-proper-use-of-tables.html) for a good breakdown of when to use tables
- Problem: they're hard to make responsive

## Tools

- [Tables Generator](http://www.tablesgenerator.com/html_tables)

### How to write tables

```html
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Age</th>
        <th>Sign</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Barack</td>
        <td>August 4</td>
        <td>Leo</td>
    </tr>
</table>
```

Then remove the default styles:

```css
table {
    border-collapse: collapse;
    border-spacing: 0;
}
```

Add some borders and padding to make things easy to read:

```css
td, th {
    border: 1px solid black;
    padding: 10px;
}
```

### Writing newsletters

- Newsletter layout required two horrible things I've told you never to use: table-based layout and inline styles (i.e. the `style=` property)
- This is because of the fragility of webmail programs, who can't support robust HTML emails without risking hackery.

### Good tools for building and testing newsletters

- [Mailchimp](http://mailchimp.com)
= [TinyLetter](http://tinyletter.com/)
- [Litmus](http://litmus.com/)
