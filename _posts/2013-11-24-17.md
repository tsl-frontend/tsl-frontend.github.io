## JavaScript

- JS is another webpage element — beyond HTML/CSS — that can get sent to browser
- You put it in a `<script>` tag, or you can call it from external file.
- JS script tags usually go at the bottom of the page, just above `</body>`.
- JS is about modifying behavior and handling interaction
- JS relies heavily on the DOM -- which is the family tree of a webpage. Look at HTML through the Inspector to undertsand the hierarchy.

## jQuery

- jQuery is a framework to make it way easier to write JS. Like Bootstrap is a framework for HTML/CSS.
- jQuery is a HUGE toolbox.
- We're going to learn one tiny use case, which is more than enough to be dangerous

## The power of nested CSS

- By simply **adding one class to one element**, we can introduce almost any dynamic behavior we want by making heavy use of nested selectors.
- We can write CSS rulesets that don't have any affect when the page is loaded, but become important once a single class is added somewhere on our page.
- e.g. `ul.active li img { border: 1px solid red; }` will only work when the `<ul>` has a class of `active`.
- jQuery gives us an easy way to add classes to elements when a particular interaction occurs.

## Formulate interactions like this:

```
When ELEMENT gets INTERACTION, apply CLASS NAME to TARGET.
```

## Some common interactions

Lots more listed in the [jQuery API](http://api.jquery.com/).

### Mouse interactions

- click
- mouseover (hover)
- mouseout (end hover)
- hover (takes two functions: on hover start, on hover end)

### Mouse interactions

- focus (element gains focus)
- blur (element leaves focus)
- change (change text in an input)
- select (select text in an input)
- submit (submit a form)

### Window interactions

- scroll
- resize

### Keyboard interactions

- keypress

## jQuery boilerplate templates

### Tips

- Don't forget to include jQuery
- You can include as many statements as you want inside the jQuery "ready" function. That is, in the example above, line 1 and 5 need to be there only once, and you can insert as many of lines 2-4 in there as you want.
- You can also include as many class additions as you want inside the function for an interaction.
- Instead of `addClass`, you may use `removeClass` or `toggleClass`.
- Use `this` to refer to the element being interacted with.
- You can include a comma-delited list to target more than one element.

### Examples

```js
<script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script>
$(function() {
  $('.my-button').click(function() {
    $('.big-box').addClass('blue');
  });

  $('.show-modal').click(function() {
    $('.screen').addClass('visible');
    $('.modal').addClass('visible');
  });

  $('input[type=text], input[type=textarea]').focus(function() {
    $(this).addClass('active');
  });
});
</script>
```
